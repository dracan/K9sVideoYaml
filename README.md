# Files for K9s YouTube video

This repository contains the files used in my K9s YouTube video, which [can be found here](https://youtu.be/A4273rg4tDw).

# Additional notes

Note that in the video, I forgot to demo actually viewing the nginx websites in the browser (which wasn't required to demo K9s anyway). If you do want follow along, but also view the nginx websites in your browser - then you'll have to add the following entries to your `hosts` file...

```
127.0.0.1 webapp1.com
127.0.0.1 webapp2.com
```

Once done, you should be able to view the sites. As I say though - actually viewing the site isn't required to follow along with the K9s video.
